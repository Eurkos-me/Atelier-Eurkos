                        I am an Information Technology professional with experience in Project Implementation, Asset Control, Technical Writing, and Team Management. My favorite type of project to work on involves the mitigation of hardware technical debt, especially in a 
                        Retail Point of Sale environment.

                        In my current role, I'm a Store Technology Analyst at <a class="content_link" href="https://www.burlington.com/" target="_blank">Burlington

                        As an "elder millenial", I have been steeped in the Internet and some degree of HTML coding for most of my life. 
                        It's only been in the past year or so that I have been actively learning how to build fully functional and 
                        accessible websites. I'm learning quickly, and would love to be able to incorporate this knowledge into a career.
